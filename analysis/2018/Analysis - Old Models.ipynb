    "# Dorm properties and individual well-being\n",
    "\n",
    "Tries to explain individuals' spring well-being scores from their fall trait survey, fall well-being, and dorm-level averages of these measures. We use only participants who completed both the fall trait survey and spring network survey (in which the spring well-being measures are embedded), leaving an N of about 200.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AIM:** We want to know things like: is the dorm's average level of Agreeableness related to individual change in well-being from fall to spring? What about the dorm's average extraversion? Empathy?\n",
    "\n",
    "**RESULTS: [INCOMPLETE]**\n",
    "1. An individual's spring well-being is strongly predicted by fall well-being, and other variables add only a little bit of extra explanatory power. Other variables considered include individual traits as well as the average traits of the person's participating dorm-mates.\n",
    "1. There's a clear regression to the mean for individuals -- those who were extra happy in the fall tend to report being less happy in the spring, and those who are extra sad in the fall tend to report being less-sad in the spring. This is reasonable, as people who are having an especially good or bad day, when they take the test in the fall, are unlikely to have a similarly extreme day when tested in the spring.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Procedure:**\n",
    "1. Filter for students who participated in BOTH the fall trait survey AND the spring well-being/network survey.\n",
    "1. Create a composite fall well-being measure from SWLS, Subjective Happiness, PSS, Loneliness, Anxiety, CESD\n",
    "  * Spring well-being composite already exists, which is an average of ~15 questions about happiness, anxiety, stress, loneliness, etc (see below).\n",
    "1. Standardize fall and spring well-being measures to 0 mean and unit variance.\n",
    "1. Predict spring WB from fall WB\n",
    "1. Predict spring WB from (fall WB + single IV) for each individual-level IV\n",
    "1. Predict spring WB from (fall WB + single IV) for each dorm-level IV\n",
    "1. Predict spring WB from all IVs, using LASSO regression and cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**(Reference): Spring well-being measure:**\n",
    "1. I feel connected to my friends and family. (Wellbeing_self_17) \n",
    "1. I feel lonely. (Lonely) \n",
    "1. I feel stressed. (Stressed) \n",

    "1. I feel depressed or down. (Depression) \n",
    "1. I lack interest or pleasure in things I usually enjoy. (Anhedonia) \n",
